  'It may take some time to get the results you want. It’s vital to break your ultimate goal down in to stages and set lots of smaller goals to keep you motivated along the way.',

  'Results come through regular and consistent activity. Stick to your programme and avoid frequent stops and starts.',

  'Do not increase the amount of exercise you do too soon. Increase what you’re doing by no more than 10% per week.',

  'When you first start exercising you’ll experience feelings of discomfort such as shortness of breath, sweating and aching muscles after exercising. Don’t worry, this is completely normal and everyone feels like this when they’re first starting out.',

  'Training with a friend not only keeps you motivated during the sessions themselves but will also make you less likely to miss a planned session as you’re unlikely to want to let down your friend.',

  'Not warming up is a mistake many beginners make. Before any session ensure that you warm up thoroughly and mobilise the areas that you will be using during the workout. Furthermore, failure to warm up properly may increase the risk of injury.',

  'We are all different. Some of us rise early and some of us go to bed late. Exercise at the time when you feel that you have most energy.',

  'Don’t give up. All beginners have set backs on the way to achieving their goals. Accept them and use them to re-motivate yourself.',

  'Ensure you drink plenty of water, before, during and after exercise, particularly if you are exercising in warm conditions or for long periods. Dehydration will result in a drop in performance and severe dehydration can be dangerous too.',

  'Keep things interesting by trying new exercises, workouts and activities to keep your programme fresh, keep challenging your body and preventing boredom.'
